# Handling

The program starts with a main menu, which gives the choice between starting a new game (*play*), displaying *help* and displaying *credits*.
*Play* starts a game; during the game, several buttons are available.
* *+1* button discloses one right digit inbetween those which have to be solved;
* the *magnifying glass* shows the whole solution;
* you can go back to the main *menu* once you are done, gave up, or at any time.

# Improvements

After editing the program and rendering a final version, we raised the following improvements we have been thinking about throughout the construction of the program:
* adding a difficulty management tool: the variable `difficulte` had been implemented for that purpose, but we finally could not go that far into the project.
* modifying the layout in order to make the 3x3 grids appear more clearly.


# Credits

This program has been created in a university context. It has been written under my management, by a French-Chinese team of four.
